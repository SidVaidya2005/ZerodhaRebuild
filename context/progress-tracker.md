# Progress Tracker

> **Role:** Live build status — what's done, in progress, and next.
> **Read at the start of every session**; **update after every completed feature.**
> **Relates to:** mirrors `build-plan.md` exactly; evicts old decisions to `constraints.md`.

Any AI agent reading this should immediately know what is done, what is in progress, and what is next.

## How this file is maintained

- **Current Status is overwritten, never appended.** It holds three lines describing only the latest state. Do not keep previous statuses here — the record of what happened lives in `build-journal.md`.
- **Progress checkboxes are edited in place** — tick the box for the completed feature. Never restate, duplicate, or re-list the checklist.
- **Key Decisions holds the 10 most recent decisions, newest first.** When adding an 11th, file the oldest bullet under its topic in `constraints.md`, so this section never exceeds 10. Eviction is a move, never a delete — an old decision can still bind.

**Phase:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Public Site
**Last completed:** 02 Design system and theme tokens — full token set, both themes, ten restyled primitives, dev-only styleguide; theme invariant machine-checked
**Next:** 03 Public layout shell

## Key Decisions

- **The shadcn CLI changed shape: `init -b radix -t next -p nova --css-variables -y`.** It now picks between Base UI, Radix and React Aria, and prompts for a style preset that `-y` does not skip. `shadcn` is also a *runtime* dependency shipping `shadcn/tailwind.css`. Resolves the standing TODO in `library-docs.md` → shadcn/ui. (F02)
- **shadcn's token vocabulary is bridged onto this project's, never merged.** A `@theme inline` block maps shadcn's names onto our palette so `shadcn add` keeps working, while project code keeps using `bg-canvas` / `text-muted` / `border-hairline`. `--color-muted` is the one real collision — shadcn means a *surface* by it, this project means the *text* grey — and it is resolved in this project's favour, with `--color-muted-foreground` defined to the same value and `bg-muted` hand-fixed on add. (F02)
- **Every `dark:` utility is stripped from added components.** Tailwind v4's built-in `dark:` variant is bound to `prefers-color-scheme`, so a leftover `dark:` class responds to the visitor's OS rather than this project's theme class — a live bug, not inert code. A grep guard enforces it. (F02)
- **Two money formatters, not one with flags.** `formatCurrency` always renders ₹ and 2dp; `formatSignedCurrency` renders an explicit +/− where the sign carries meaning. `Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN')` produces Indian digit grouping natively, so nothing is hand-rolled. (F02)
- **TypeScript is pinned to 6.0.3 and ESLint to 9.39.5, both below their available latest.** `typescript-eslint` refuses to load against the TS 7 API, and `eslint-plugin-react` 7.37.5 crashes on ESLint 10's rule-context API — each breaks `pnpm lint` outright. Re-test both when those upstreams ship support; `architecture.md`'s version table carries the reason. (F01)
- **Supabase provisioning is deferred out of F01 to Phase 2.** The free plan caps active projects at two per org and both slots already hold unrelated projects (`NextBnb` active, `SpotifyAgain` paused). F10 already calls for creating and linking the project, so F01 and F10 were duplicating the step. (F01)
- **F07 (Support form) conflicts with that deferral and is unresolved.** It sits in Phase 1 and needs a `support_messages` migration, so Phase 1 cannot complete without a Supabase project existing. Decide this when F07 is architected — do not discover it mid-build. (F01)
- **Environment validation is split across two modules**, deviating from `code-standards.md`'s single `env.ts`, which was updated to match. `env.ts` holds the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables and is safe anywhere; `env.server.ts` carries `import 'server-only'` so a client-side import of the service-role key fails the build instead of throwing at runtime. Validation is forced at boot by `register()` in `src/instrumentation.ts`, which Next.js skips during `next build` — so `build` stays green without secrets while `dev` and `start` fail by name. (F01)
- **Dependencies are pinned exactly, with no caret ranges.** Every version in `architecture.md` was verified to equal the current registry `latest`, so the table, the lockfile and `package.json` all agree and can only diverge by a deliberate edit. (F01)
- **Tier 1 tests run in Vitest's node environment with no jsdom and no Testing Library.** Neither is an approved dependency, and `code-standards.md` scopes tier 1 to pure logic. Component behaviour is proven in the browser, not in a simulated DOM. (F01)
