## Open questions

- **Should a concurrency abort be distinguishable from a genuine row fault in `square_off_mis`'s returned counters?** `exception when others` counts a `40P01` deadlock as `faulted`, which is what made F29's inverted lock order look like a clean run. The lock order is fixed and `15-lock-order.sql` pins it, so this is no longer masking a known bug — but the two remain indistinguishable to anything reading the counters, and `match_open_orders` carries the identical handler. Deferred at the Phase 4 checkpoint, twice. **Asked, unanswered.**
